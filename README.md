# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio  

## Overview  
This ePortfolio serves as the final project for my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at SNHU. It showcases my growth as a software developer through several components including an initial artifact code review, three core artifact enhancements, and reflections on core competencies in computer science.  

## Contents  
- **Professional Self-Assessment** – A reflection on my learning journey.  
- **Enhancements** – Significant improvements made to the Breakout game developed during CS-330, focusing on software engineering, security, and data structures.
