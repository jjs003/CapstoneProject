## Professional Self-Assessment
My journey with SNHU began in May of 2023. It took me just over a decade to pick my computer science degree back up after taking a hiatus due to the complications of life. Throughout this degree, I have learned so many new concepts and strengthened knowledge in programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. Through each course that has led me here, I have built a strong foundation in database management, software engineering, programming, and security.

One of the most valuable aspects of my education so far has been learning how to operate effectively in a team environment. The Software Development Lifecycle course was instrumental in this regard introducing the Agile methodologies and the importance of effective communication. This course explored the theory behind the Agile methodologies, the different roles on an agile team, and really helped solidify my understanding of proper project management skills. Throughout the rest of my courses, these concepts were further refined which has helped me develop strong collaboration skills, ensuring that I can work efficiently with cross-functional teams.

My understanding of effective communication was enhanced further through System Analysis and Design, where I learned how to translate complex technical concepts into clear and concise documentation, diagrams, and presentations. This course provided experience in creating a business requirements document, UML diagrams, Gantt charts, and other various forms of visual communications. These skills have been invaluable in ensuring that technical ideas are communicated effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By learning how to document system requirements, design architectures, and create project timelines, I have developed the ability to bridge the gap between development teams and business objectives. This experience has strengthened my ability to present ideas clearly, justify design decisions, and collaborate with diverse audiences, all of which are essential skills in a professional software development environment.

Throughout this journey, I have developed a strong ability to create efficient data structures and algorithms, which likely began in the Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design course. This course introduced various data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, binary search trees, and vectors comparing them for efficiency and applicability in different scenarios. Through hands-on coding exercises and algorithmic problem-solving, I learned how to analyze time and space complexity using Big-O notation. These skills have been instrumental in my ability to write efficient, maintainable software. Applying this knowledge beyond the classroom, I have implemented data structures in various projects, ensuring that my solutions are not only functional but also optimized for real-world applications.

My coursework has also strengthened my abilities in software engineering and databases. The Introduction to Structured Database Environments, Full Stack Development and Client/Server Development courses taught me how to design and develop applications that integrate databases, focusing on data integrity and security. Introduction to Structured Database Environments taught the basics of SQL, whereas Client/Server Development focused on MongoDB in a Python environment, and Full Stack Development I expanded on these concepts by integrating databases into web applications, emphasizing both front-end and back-end interactions.  This skill became particularly valuable when implementing an SQLite database for my capstone project, where I designed a high-score tracking system for my Breakout game, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.

Security is another critical area I have developed expertise in. Courses such as Software Security, Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, and Secure Coding reinforced the importance of writing secure code, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing encryption techniques. Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance provided hands-on experience with creating test cases within a Java environment while reinforcing best practices for software validation, verification, and automated testing. Secure Coding focused on recognizing and mitigating common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, and cross-site scripting, equipping me with strategies to develop more resilient software. In Software Security, I gained a deeper understanding of advanced security concepts, including authentication, authorization, cryptography, and secure software design. The course covered threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and best practices for protecting applications against cyber threats. Through hands-on assignments, I learned to apply security principles in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the software I develop is created with a security first mindset and resistant to threats. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in writing secure, reliable code that meets industry standards and best practices.

In addition to the core programming concepts that I have studied in most of my classes, I have also had the opportunity to experience other facets of the programming world such as Android application design through Mobile Archictecture and Programming, user interface and user experience design through UI/UX Design and Development, embedded system development in Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology, and game/graphics design during Computer Graphic and Visualization. These classes and several others helped to broaden my understanding of the computer science field by exposing me to diverse applications of programming beyond traditional software development. Mobile Architecture and Programming provided hands-on experience in developing Android applications, focusing on user-centered design principles and industry best practices. UI/UX Design and Development emphasized the importance of usability, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal in software design, teaching me how to create intuitive and engaging user interfaces. Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology introduced me to embedded systems development, giving me insight into hardware-software integration and performance optimization. Finally, Computer Graphic and Visualization allowed me to explore game and graphics programming, where I learned to create interactive 3D objects and implement real-time rendering techniques.

These courses, along with many others, have expanded my understanding of the computer science field, equipping me with a well-rounded skill set that enables me to approach problem-solving from multiple perspectives. This breadth of knowledge has strengthened my adaptability and versatility, preparing me to tackle challenges across various domains in the industry.
